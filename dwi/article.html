<h2>The Go programming language</h2>
<p><a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank">The Go programming language</a> is a technology created at Google to improve and evolve internal softwares used in this big tech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golang was designed by <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer" target="_blank">Robert Griesemer</a>, <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike" target="_blank">TRob Pike</a> and <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson" target="_blank">Ken Thompson</a>, three software engineers at Google, in 2007. Then, it was announced in November 2009 and released in March 2012 with its version 1.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Go is at version 1.22. It is widely used at Google and in many other important companies like PayPal, America Express, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Uber, Monzo, Dropbox and much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also used for large open source projects and for people that want to create great, stable and fast softwares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Golang?</h2>
<p><strong>What is Go? Go, also known as Golang, is a high-level, statically typed, compiled, memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing and CSP-style concurrency programming language.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incredibly fast and stable, today Go is used by important companies and by millions of developers and software engineers around the world that want to create websites, web applications and software with a great programming language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golang prioritises both static typing for efficiency and clear, concise syntax for readability. In fact, it was designed to combine the static typing of C with the readability of Python, becoming a programming language widely used due to its characteristics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Go good for?</h2>
<p><strong>What is Go good for? Golang excels in buildings:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Cloud and Network Services</li>
    <li>Command-line interfaces</li>
    <li>Web Development</li>
    <li>DevOps and Site Reliability</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://go.dev/solutions/cloud" target="_blank">Cloud and Network Services</a></p>
<p>Its concurrency features make it ideal for scalable backend systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
