    <p><strong>What is React? React is a front-end JavaScript library used for creating user interfaces based on components.</strong></p>
    <p>Also known as React.js or ReactJS, it is one of the most famous technologies used to create web applications that require constant data changes on their UIs without reloading the entire web app.</p>
    <p>In this new tutorial of DevWithIt, we are going to discover React and its most important concepts creating a To Do App.</p>
    <p>Let’s code it but before that, let’s see in more detail what React is and why we use it.</p>

    <h2 id="1">React: what is it?</h2>
    <p><a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React: what is it</a>? React is a declarative, flexible, and open-source JavaScript library that is used to create user interfaces based on components. It can be used to develop single-page, server-rendered applications with its framework like Next.js and mobile app thanks React Native.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this tutorial of <em>DevWithIt</em> we are going to be focusing only on React. However, once you know the basics of React, it will be easy to switch to <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank">React Native</a> or to one of the React frameworks like <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>, <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://remix.run/" target="_blank">Remix</a> or <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You can use React to create an entire web app like we will do in this tutorial dedicated to React, as well as you can <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project" target="_blank">add React to an existing project</a> - e.g in a PHP project, you can add some React components to a small part of the web app. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>React was developed by Jordan Walke, one of Facebook’s software engineers. It was released in 2013 and today it is maintained by Meta.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After its first release, React became one of the most popular JavaScript libraries. Why? Let’s find out in the next paragraph when and why it is important to use React.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="2">Why use React?</h2>
    <p>Why use React? Some advantages of React are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>It allows to build web apps in an efficient way</p></li>
        <li><p>It allows to organise and maintain the code in an good way</p></li>
        <li><p>It allows to reuse its components</p></li>
        <li><p>It is declarative</p></li>
        <li><p>It is composable</p></li>
        <li><p>It is fast</p></li>
        <li><p>It is efficient</p></li>
        <li><p>It is SEO friendly</p></li>
        <li><p>It guarantees stable code</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Don’t worry if you do not understand all the above points, you will master all of them coding along this tutorial of <em>DevWithIt</em> where we will create a To Do App with React.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are different reasons, the first that we have to mention is that this JavaScript library allows us to build complex UI in an efficient way, organising and maintaining the code in an efficient way.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In React everything is a component. Components are independent and reusable parts of code that can be reused throughout the application.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>React is <strong>declarative</strong>, that means that it updates and renders components when data changes, as well as, it is <strong>composable</strong>, that means that the web app is composed of freely interchangeable components.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>React is SEO friendly, fast, efficient and it guarantees stable code thanks to the maintenance of Meta and thanks to its strong community.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of the main concepts and one of the performance benefits of React is the <strong>Virtual DOM</strong>, a lightweight JavaScript representation of the DOM - Document Object Model, used in declarative programming like React, VueJS and Angular. Basically, React uses the virtual DOM to track changes to the user interface and it updates the real DOM when necessary, improving the performance of the web apps by preventing unnecessary DOM manipulations.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="3">React and JSX</h2>
    <p>If you want to be a React Engineer, you will use <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSX_(JavaScript)" target="_blank">JSX</a> quite often. JSX is an extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML markup inside a JavaScript file. As highlighted in the official React documentation, <a class="link" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx" target="_blank">writing markup with JSX</a> is what most React developers prefer to do.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will learn about React and JSX during this tutorial but let’s see how JSX keeps our life easier with an example. We show you a React component without JSX and then the same React component with JSX, also if you do not understand 100% the code yet, you can see how JSX is more readable than plain React.</p>
    <!-- Codeblock Start -->
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="content__code-file"><strong>React component without JSX</strong></p>
    <div class="codeblock">
        <div class="codeblock__container">
<pre class="codeblock__pre">
<code class="codeblock__code">
const Title = () => {
    return React.createElement('h1', null, `This is a title`);
};    
</code>
</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Codeblock End -->
    <!-- Codeblock Start -->
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="content__code-file"><strong>React component with JSX</strong></p>
    <div class="codeblock">
        <div class="codeblock__container">
<pre class="codeblock__pre">
<code class="codeblock__code">
const Title = () => {
    return (
        <h1>This is a title</h1>
    );
};       
</code>
</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Codeblock End -->
    <p>That’s it for this introduction about React.</p>
